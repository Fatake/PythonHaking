Thursday 23 July,Keynote: Designed for Education: A Python Solution,python,"The problem of introducing children to programming and computer science has
seen growing attention in the past few years. Initiatives like Raspberry
Pi, Code Club, code.org, (and many more) have been created to help solve
this problem. With the introduction of a national computing curriculum in
the UK, teachers have been searching for a text based programming language
to help teach computational thinking as a follow on from visual languages
like Scratch.,The educational community has been served well by Python, benefiting from
its straight-forward syntax, large selection of libraries, and supportive
community. Education-focused summits are now a major part of most major
Python Conferences. Assistance in terms of documentation and training is
invaluable, but perhaps there are technical means of improving the
experience of those using Python in education. Clearly the needs of
teachers and their students are different to those of the seasoned
programmer. Children are unlikely to come to their teachers with
frustrations about the Global Interpreter Lock! But issues such as
usability of IDEs or comprehensibility of error messages are of utmost
importance.,In this keynote, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python
becoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer science, and
how learning Python could be helped immensely through tooling and further
support from the Python developer community.",Carrie Anne Philbin
Wednesday 22 July,A Pythonic Approach to Continuous Delivery,"Operations,ApplicationLifecycle,ConfigurationManagement,Devpi,ContinuousDelivery,DevOps,ansible,Jenkins","Software development is all about writing code that delivers additional value to a customer. Following the agile and lean approach this value created by code changes should be continuously delivered as fast, as early and as often as possible without any compromise on the quality. 
Remarkably, there is a huge gap between the development of the application code and the reliable and scalable operation of the application. As an example, most of the tutorials about web development with Flask or Django end by starting a local “dummy” server, missing out all the steps needed for production ready operation of the web service. Furthermore, as there is no “rocket science” in-between, many proposals to bridge that gap from both sides, operations and developers start with sentences like: “you just have to…”, a clear indication that it will cause problems later on and also a symptom of a cultural gap between developers and operations staff.
In this talk I will go through the complete delivery pipeline from application development to the industrial grade operation, clearly biased towards the “DevOps” mindset. Instead of presenting a sophisticated enterprise solution, I will outline the necessary building blocks for continuous delivery and fill them up with simple but working poor man’s solutions, so that it is equally useful for professional and non-professional developers and operations engineers. After the talk you will know how to build such a continuous delivery pipeline with open-source tools like “Ansible”, “Devpi” and “Jenkins” and I will share some of my day-to-day experiences with automation in general. Although many of the concepts are language agnostic I will focus on the ins and outs in a python universe and outline the pythonic way of “get this thing running”.",Sebastian Neubauer
Tuesday 21 July,Argus - the omniscient CI,"cloudbase-init,continuous-integration,open-source,windows,Testing,argus,linux,OpenStack,devstack,cloud","Bring the continuous integration to a new level, through a platform/project independent framework able to give you unittest-like reports. Argus is a scenario-based application written in Python, driven by custom recipes under configurable environments, that can be used for testing a wide variety of small and big projects, with the ability of querying live data from the in-test application.,Until now, it’s successfully used with ,cloudbase-init, (a robust cloud initialization service for instances) under OpenStack and not only, due to its extensiveness and the ability to mimic different infrastructures. More details can be found on the package page: https://github.com/PCManticore/argus-ci.,The goals of this talk are to show its generic scalability, how simple is to create such kind of recipes, the relationship between scenarios, introspection and tests and, but not last, the unlimited freedom of creating very custom aspects of these entities which lead to relevant and in-depth ready for analysis logs. There are no major prerequisites to understand it, just to be familiar with Python and optionally have a focus on cloud infrastructures.",Cosmin Poieana
Friday 24 July,Arrested Development - surviving the awkward adolescence of a microservices-based application,"services,distributed-systems,HTTP","The potential upside of microservices is significant and exciting. So much so that Yelp’s Transaction Platform committed from the start to an architecture of small, cooperative microservices. This talk explores the inevitable complications that arise for Python developers in as the services grow larger and stretch both their own architecture and the developers responsible for them. Come hear tales of terror (tight coupling! low test coverage!), stories which will warm your heart (agility! strong interfaces!), and everything in between as we follow the adventures of our plucky team.,The talk will be focused on the functional, cultural, and reliability challenges which occur as a microservices-based project evolves and expands over time. Particular attention will be paid to where these diverge from the utopian way microservices are often described, and to the particular difficulties faced by Python developers trying to implement such systems. My goal is to share with attendees some mistakes we’ve made, some successful methods for growing gracefully, and Python-specific tools/libraries which can help with these problems.,To enjoy this talk, you should be aware of the basic vocabulary and concepts of HTTP-based services. Any additional awareness of distributed systems (and their failure modes) will be helpful.",Scott Triglia
Thursday 23 July,Antipatterns for Diversity,"Best Practice,diversity,community,inclusion","Stop doing the same thing but expecting different results,As developers we put considerable effort into optimisation. We are always tinkering, trying to make things better, and striving to remove antipatterns from our code and our development processes. ,Yet for some reason we have not been as good at applying this spirit of optimisation to the problem of increasing diversity, even though most people these days agree that, like good tests, agile methodologies, and virtual environments, diversity is a “good thing”.,My position is that just as there is no single easy way to write good code there is no single easy way to increasing diversity. There are, however, several things that companies and organisations do which actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these antipatterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in meritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of marginalisation, null processes, misunderstanding of “culture fit”, and an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams, companies, and organisations might work to combat them.",Naomi Ceder

Wednesday 22 July,"asyncio community, one year later","networking,aiohttp,python3,asyncio","The asyncio project was officially launched with the release of Python 3.4 in March 2014. The project was public before that under the name “tulip”. asyncio is just a core network library, it requires third party library to be usable for common protocols. One year later, asyncio has a strong community writing libraries on top of it.,The most advanced library is aiohttp which includes a complete HTTP client but also a HTTP server. There are also libraries to access asynchronously the file system, resolve names with DNS, have variables local to tasks, read-write locks, etc. There are clients for AMQP, Asterisk, ElasticSearch, IRC, XMPP (Jabber), etc. (and even an IRC server!). There are asynchronous drivers for all common databases, and even for some ORMs. As expected, there are tons of new web frameworks based on asyncio. It’s also possible to plug asyncio into Gtk, Qt, gevent, eventlet, gunicorn, tornado, etc.,I will also discuss use cases of asyncio in production and benchmarks. Spoiler: asyncio is not slow.,The asyncio library also evolved to become more usable: it has a better documentation, is easier to debug and has a few new functions. There is also a port to Python 2: trollius.",Victor Stinner
Thursday 23 July,"Architecture of a cloud hosting service using python technologies: django, ansible and celery","celery,ansible,hosting,cloud,django","The talk will show the architecture and inners of a cloud hosting service we are developing in the University of Cambridge based on python technologies, mainly django, ansible, and celery.,The users manage their hosts using a web panel, developed in django, with common options: ability to create a vhost, associate domain names to vhosts, install packages, recover from backups, make snapshots, etc. Interaction between the panel and the hosts are made using ansible playbooks launched asynchronously by celery tasks. The VM architecture has been designed to be VM platform agnostic and to provide disk replication and high availability.,The University of Cambridge central IT services (http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/) also provides other services to the rest of the university like domain name registration, authentication, authorisation, TLS certificates, etc. We link all these other services with the hosting service by using APIs while keeping a microservices architecture approach. Thus, enabling the use/link of other services  within the same hosting service web application. ",Abraham Martin
Tuesday 21 July,A Deep Look at Logging,"web,logging,BestPractices","Do you know what your application did last night? Python logging can help you.,This talk you will show you how to implement a systematic logging approach without boilerplate code and how to set up the Python logging module for different needs in production systems.  We will see how to  work with log files and other logging endpoints.  We will address the data protection concerns that come up when logging  from application with personal  information. We will also look at the performance implications of logging. We will then cover best practices - how to structure logging, what to include in a log message, and how to configure logging for different use cases.,We will use the Python standard logging module to implement logging.  This talk is useful to beginners with some experience.  An understanding of decorators is useful, but not required.  Some experience in web programming is a plus.",Stefan Baerisch
Wednesday 22 July,12 years of Pylint  (or How I learned to stop worrying about bugs),"static-analysis,lint,typehinting,ast","Given the dynamic nature of Python, some bugs tend to creep in our codebases. Innocents NameErrors or hard-to-find bugs with variables used in a closure, but defined in a loop, they all stand no chance in front of Pylint (http://pylint.org/).
In this talk, I’ll present one of the oldest static analysis tools for Python, with emphasis on what it can do to understand your Python code.  Pylint is both a style checker, enforcing PEP 8 rules, as well as a code checker in the vein of pyflakes and the likes, but its true power isn’t always obvious to the eye of beholder.  It can detect simple bugs such as unused variables and imports, but it can also detect more complicated cases such as invalid arguments passed to functions, it understands the method resolution order of your classes and what special methods aren’t implemented correctly. Starting from abstract syntax trees, we’ll go through its inference engine and we’ll see how Pylint understands the logical flow of your program and what sort of type hinting techniques are used to improve its inference, including PEP 484 type hints. As a bonus, I’ll show how it can be used to help you port your long-forgotten library to Python 3, using its new –py3k mode.,Link to presentation: http://pcmanticore.github.io/pylint-talks/#slide:1",Claudiu Popa

Wednesday 22 July,"Keynote: Towards a more effective, decentralized web",python,"Many would like to see more decentralization but what does it mean, really?  In this talk, I’ll discuss the recent rise of immutable state concepts in languages and network protocols.  And how the advent of hash-based data structures and replication strategies are shaking the client/server web service paradigm which rests on managing mutable state through http.  By contrast, building on git, bittorrent and other content addressed data structures provides for a more secure, efficient decentralized communication topology.   There are projects, thoughts and talk to create new web standards to bring such technologies to mass deployment and fuel a new wave of decentralization.  What can Python bring to the table?

Friday 24 July,"Keynote: So, I have all these Docker containers, now what?","python,docker,cloud","You’ve solved the issue of process-level reproducibility by packaging up
your apps and execution environments into a number of Docker containers.
But once you have a lot of containers running, you’ll probably need to
coordinate them across a cluster of machines while keeping them healthy and
making sure they can find each other. Trying to do this imperatively can
quickly turn into an unmanageable mess! Wouldn’t it be helpful if you could
declare to your cluster what you want it to do, and then have the cluster
assign the resources to get it done and to recover from failures and scale
on demand?

Kubernetes (http://kubernetes.io) is an open source, cross platform cluster
management and container orchestration platform that simplifies the complex
tasks of deploying and managing your applications in Docker containers. You
declare a desired state, and Kubernetes does all the work needed to create

at how to map common applications to these concepts. This will include a
hands-on demonstration and visualization of the steps involved in getting
an application up and running on Kubernetes.",Mandy Waite

Thursday 23 July,Functional Programming with Transducers in Python,"python,fun,Functional Programming,functional","Transducers – a portmanteau of ‘transform reducers’ – are a new functional programming concept, which were first introduced into the Clojure programming language.  Although transducers are actually pretty straightforward in retrospect, wrapping your brain around them can be challenging. ,Transducers allow us to fuse multiple data processing operations together so they can be applied in a single pass over a data series – similar to how Python generator functions allow us to process iterable series.  However, unlike generator functions they are completely decoupled from the data series abstraction and can be used on eager sequences, lazy iterables, coroutine-based push events and events such as those modelled by Reactive Extensions for Python (RxPy). ,In this workshop, we introduce transducers by implementing them from scratch in Python 3. We’ll start with the familiar staples of functional programming, map(), filter() and reduce(), and derive transducers from first principles. We’ll work towards a set of general tools which works with eager collections, lazy ‘pull’ sequences, and coroutine ‘push’ event streams and RxPy. Along the way we’ll cover stateful transducers and transducer composition, demonstrating that transducers are both more general, and more fundamental, than the functional programming tools baked into Python and many other languages.,There are no prerequisites for this workshop as we stick to core Python 3 language features although an enthusiasm for a functional programming style will be sure to help attendees get the most out of this session.",Austin Bingham
"Monday 20 July,Monday 20 July",Modern optimization methods in Python,"analytics,optimization,data-science,predictions,framework","Highly-constrained, large-dimensional, and non-linear optimizations are found at the root of most of today’s forefront problems in statistics, quantitative finance, risk, operations research, materials design, and other predictive sciences. Tools for optimization, however, have not changed much in the past 40 years – until very recently. The abundance of parallel computing resources has stimulated a shift away from using reduced models to solve statistical and predictive problems, and toward more direct methods for solving high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems.,This tutorial, will introduce modern tools for solving optimization problems – beginning with traditional methods, and extending to solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems with highly nonlinear constraints. We will start by introducing the cost function, and it’s use in local and global optimization. We will then address how to monitor and diagnose your optimization convergence and results, tune your optimizer, and utilize compound termination conditions. This tutorial will discuss building and applying box constraints, penalty functions, and symbolic constraints. We will then demonstrate methods to efficiently reduce search space through the use of robust optimization constraints.  Real-world inverse problems can be expensive, thus we will show how to enable your optimization to seamlessly leverage parallel computing. Large-scale optimizations also can greatly benefit from efficient solver restarts and the saving of state. This tutorial will cover using asynchronous computing for results caching and archiving, dynamic real-time optimization, and dimensional reduction. Next we will discuss new optimization methods that leverage parallel computing to perform blazingly-fast global optimizations and n-dimensional global searches. Finally, we will close with applications of global optimization in statistics and quantitative finance.,The audience need not be an expert in optimization, but should have interest in solving hard real-world optimization problems.  We will introduce the ,mystic, optimization framework – then begin with a walk through some introductory optimizations, learning how to build confidence in understanding your results. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have working knowledge of how to use modern constrained optimization tools, how to enable their solvers to leverage high-performance parallel computing, and how to utilize legacy data and surrogate models in statistical and predictive risk modeling.,PREREQUISITES,: This tutorial will assume attendees have basic knowledge of ,python, and ,numpy,, and is intended for scientific developers who are interested in utilizing optimization to solve real-world problems in statistics, quantitative finance, and predictive sciences.

"Friday 24 July,Friday 24 July","Faster Python Programs - Measure, don't Guess","optimization,profiling","Software requirements,Optimization can often help to make Python programs faster or use less memory.
Developing a strategy, establishing solid measuring and visualization techniques
as well as knowing about algorithmic basics and datastructures are the foundation
for a successful optimization. The tutorial will cover these topics.
Examples will give you a hands-on experience on how to approach efficiently.,Audience,: Programmers with good basic Python knowledge. No previous
knowledge in the field of optimization is required.,Objectives,: This tutorial will help you to get the most out of your optimization work.
You will learn useful techniques for details combined with an overall strategy
for the big picture.,Detailed Abstract,: Python is a great language. But it can be slow compared to other languages for certain types of tasks. If applied appropriately, optimization may reduce program runtime or memory consumption considerably. But this often comes at a price. Optimization can be time consuming and the optimized program may be more complicated. This, in turn, means more maintenance effort. How do you find out if it is worthwhile to optimize your program? Where should you start?
This tutorial will help you to answer these questions. You will learn how to find  an optimization strategy based on quantitative and objective criteria.
You will experience that one’s gut feeling what to optimize is often wrong.,The solution to this problem is: „Measure, Measure, and Measure!“. You will
learn how to measure program run times as well as profile CPU and memory.
There are great tools available. You will learn how to use some of them.
Measuring is not easy because, by definition, as soon as you start to measure,
you influence your system. Keeping this impact as small as possible is
important. Therefore, we will cover different measuring techniques.,Furthermore, we will look at algorithmic improvements. You will see that the
right data structure for the job can make a big difference. Finally, you will
learn about different caching techniques.,More Info,: You will need Python 2.7 or 3.4 installed on your laptop. Python 2.6 or 3.3 should also work. Very detailed installation instructions will be given to all participants well before the course.,Software requirements",Mike Müller

We will see how to use DEPOT to provide attachments on SQLAlchemy or MongoDB and how to handle problems like migration to a different storage backend and long term evolution.,Like SQLAlchemy makes possible to switch your storage on the fly without touching code, DEPOT aims at making so possible for files and even use multiple different storages together.",Alessandro Molina
Thursday 23 July,What's the fuzz all about? Randomized data generation for robust unit testing,"unit-testing,hypothesis,fuzzing","In static unit testing, the output of a function is compared to a precomputed result. Even though such unit tests may apparently cover all the code in a function, they might cover only a small subset of behaviours of the function. This potentially allows bugs such as heartbleed to stay undetected. Dynamic unit tests using fuzzing, which allows you to specify a data generation template, can make your test suite more robust.,In this talk, we demonstrate fuzzing using the hypothesis library.
Hypothesis is a Python library to automatically generate test data based on a template.
Data is generated using a strategy. A strategy specifies how data is generated, and how falsifying examples can be simplified. Hypothesis provides strategies for Python’s built-in data types, and is easily customizable.Since test data is generated automatically, we can not compare against pre-computed results. Instead, tests are usually done on invariants of functions. We give an overview of such invariants.,Finally, we demonstrate how we use fuzzing to test machine learning algorithms at Blue Yonder.",Moritz Gronbach

Monday 20 July,What is wrong with API wrappers and how can we do better,"web,HTTP,wrapper,api,ipython,requests","Wrappers are an essential tool for interacting with web APIs. They reduce the amount of work needed to make requests and sometimes, only sometimes prevent the developer from dealing with extensive documentations. It’s common to encounter libs that require not only the study of their own documentation, but also the APIs one, duplicating the needed work. This is caused because wrappers do not follow a design pattern, each developer creates it’s own design, coding style and use their preferred tools.   ,Tapioca, is what can be called: “a wrapper generator”. Creating API wrappers with Tapioca is extremely easy and fast. For example, it took 1 hour to write the full wrapper for the ,Parse.com, REST API. But this is not the more important thing, Tapioca libs have a similar interface so once understood how they work, developers can work with any other without the need to learn a new interface.    ,Tapioca is also thought to comply with REST features and takes HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the engine of application state) seriously, so “following” links and pagination are natively supported. Explorability is also a key concept and developers are encouraged to play with Tapioca packages and find their way through APIs before writing their final code. Although there are some production ready ,Tapioca wrappers,, it is a work in progress, there are still many features to be explored.",Filipe Ximenes

Tuesday 21 July,Understanding Non-blocking IO,"web,asyncronous,networking","As an engineer working on any web stack, you may have heard about Blocking and Non-Blocking IO. You may as well have used any framework or library that supports Non-Blocking IO. After all, they are very useful as you don’t want to block execution of other tasks while one task is waiting to complete a network call to another service (like HTTP call to an API or may be a TCP call to your database). Non-Blocking IO while doing tasks and not wait for IO. This also helps us handle a lot many connections than we possibly could with Blocking IO. Python supports Non-Blocking IO, but we always use some existing 3rd party library that hides all the gory details and makes it all look like black magic to the uninitiated. But there is nothing like black magic.,This presentation will be an introductory talk focused at explaining how Non-Blocking IO works, which is the basis of libraries like Gevent, Tornado and Twisted. We will learn about how Non-Blocking IO can be implemented using the most basic modules that form the base for the above mentioned libraries. Hopefully after this talk, Non-Blocking IO will not be an unsolved mystery for you anymore.",Vaidik Kapoor

Friday 24 July,Tuning Python applications can dramatically increase performance,"Development,visualization,profiling,cpython,python,metrics,Tooling,performance","Traditional Python profiling tools have limitations.  Standard tools like ,cProfile, and most all third party tools (like ,Python Tools, plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio) suffer from common flaws.  First, the profiling overhead is high (up to 50%).  Second, the  information provided is “function-level” i.e. the  tool shows how much time was spent within a function, but not actionable “line-level” information to show which exact lines are ,the bottleneck, in a function.  Adding “line-level” information to most tools causes the application to run even slower. Third, some tools require modification of the application source code to enable profiling thus disrupting development.,This talk presents an experimental Python profiler.  It typically has less than 15% overhead, shows line-level information and does not require modification of application source code.  Experiments using it resulted in performance gains of 2x and more.  Of course results vary by application, but in a typical application there may be quick optimizations easily identified by this type of profiler.,The talk will briefly describe the basics of what, why and how to profile.  The profiler‘s use and results will be shown in the presentation with examples based on real-life applications.  Previous experience of working with profilers and trying to optimize an application is a plus, but not required, to gain a better appreciation of the work presented.",Vasilij Litvinov

What began as an experiment in increasing software audience proved to be an interesting exercise in strengthening community and most valuable of all, provided a newcomer’s perspective to veteran contributors.,This talk will discuss what worked well with “adopt pytest month”, what didn’t, what we learned about pytest and what you could take away for your open source project, be it an improved testing environment or an improved contributor community. A basic knowledge of testing and pytest will be useful.",Brianna Laugher

Tuesday 21 July,The hook-based plugin architecture of py.test,"architecture,software-design,plugin","The hook-based plugin system used by py.test and being made available
as a stand alone package allows easy extensibility based on defined
extension points which can be implemented using hook functions in the
plugins.  Plugins can themselves call these hooks as well as define
future extension points allowing for a very flexible design.,py.test itself uses this plugin system from the ground up with the
entire application being implemented by built-in plugins.  This
architecture has proven powerful and flexible over the years, on both
command line tools as well as long running daemons.  This talks will
describe how the plugin system works and how it deals with passing
arguments and return values 1:N hook calls. It will also describe how
to design an application consisting entirely of plugins.  While not
specifically talking about py.test it will also give a solid
understanding on how plugins work in py.test.,Slides: http://devork.be/talks/pluggy/pluggy.html,Org-mode source: http://devork.be/talks/pluggy/pluggy.org",Floris Bruynooghe
Thursday 23 July,The GIL is dead: PyPy-STM,"GIL,PyPy,concurrency","Take a big, non-multithreaded program, and run in on multiple cores!,PyPy, the Python implementation written in Python, experimentally
supports Software Transactional Memory (STM).  It runs without the
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).,The strength of STM is not only to remove the GIL, but to also enable
a novel use of multithreading, inheritently safe, and more useful in
the general case than other approaches like OpenMP.  The main news
from last year’s presentation is that there is now a way to get
reports about the “STM conflicts”, which is essential to go past toy
examples.  With it, you can incrementally remove conflicts from large
code bases until you see a benefit from PyPy-STM.  The goal of the
talk is to give several concrete examples of doing that.",Armin Rigo

Thursday 23 July,Testing with two failure seeking missiles: fuzzing and property based testing,"Testing,fuzzing","Testing with purely random data on it’s own doesn’t get you very far. But
two approaches that have been around for a while have new libraries that
help you generate random input, that homes in on failing testcases.,First ,Hypothesis,, a Python implementation and update of the Haskell library
QuickCheck. Known as property based testing, you specify a property of your
code that must hold, and Hypothesis does its best to find a counterexample.
It then shrinks this to find the minimal input that contradicts your
property.,Second, ,American fuzzy lop, (AFL), is a young fuzzing library that’s already
achieved an impressive trophy case of bug discoveries. Using
instrumentation and genetic algorithms, it generates test input that
carefully searches out as many code paths as it can find, seeking greater
functional coverage and ultimately locating crashes and hangs that no other
method has found. I’ll be showing how with ,Python-AFL, we can apply this
tool to our Python code.",Tom Viner
Tuesday 21 July,TDD is not about tests!,"Best Practice,Development,python,agile,Testing,Coding,tdd","TDD is not about tests!
Well, actually, it’s not a about writing tests, or writing them before the code. This talk will show you how to use tests to really drive development by transforming business requirements into tests, and allowing your code to come as their natural consequence.,Too often this key aspect is neglected and the result is that tests and code are somehow “disconnected”. The code is not as short and efficient as it could be, and the tests are not as effective. Refactoring is not always easy, and over time all sorts of issues start to come out of the surface.,However, we will show that when TDD is done properly, tests and code merge beautifully into an organic whole that fulfills the business requirements, and provides all sorts of advantages: your code is minimal, easy to amend and extend, readable, clean. Your tests will be effective, short and focused, and allow for light-hearted refactoring and excellent coverage.,We will provide enough information and examples to spark the curiosity of the novice, and satisfy the need of a deeper insight for the intermediate, and help you immediately benefit from this transformative technique that is still often underestimated and misunderstood.,Slides: ,http://slides.com/gianchub/ep2015-tdd#/",Fabrizio Romano

The talk will go over what exactly a static type system is, and what kind of problem it tries to solve. We will also review Guido’s proposal of type hinting, and what it could mean to you. Finally, I will present a few libraries that are available, such as Hypothesis  or various QuickCheck-inspired library that tries to build more robust tests, how they achieve it and their limitations. Throughout the talk, a lot of examples will used to fully illustrate the ideas being explained. ,At the end of this talk, you should have a better understanding of the wonderful world of type systems, and what it really means to you. It should help you decide wether using type hints will be helpful to you and also if an external library trying to fuzz your tests has its place inside your project ",Jean-Philippe Caissy

You get lots of jokes about language features Ruby has but Python lacks and lots of disbelief that Python will survive the 2/3 split. People also tend to apply the best practices and conventions of Ruby to Python code as if t
hey were the same. Python’s major inroad at Braintree has been, surprisingly enough, as a platform for high-concurrency situations. This is a direct result of the power of Tornado as a platform for asynchronous I/O. It also helps that many Python is very approachable and 
many developers have at least some experience with it.,Braintree has three pieces of our infrastructure using Python and Tornado – an incoming request proxy; an outgoing request proxy; and a webook delivery service. They’ve served us well for 3+ years but all suffer from a number of problems. The outdated concurrency feature
s of CPython / Python 2 as well as our lack of experience with and commitment to Tornado have always been an issue. As the meat of the talk, I’ll speak in depth about the other issues we’ve encountered with each of the three applications and our short- and long- term solu

interpreter around and while it should generally just speed up your programs
there is a wide range of performance that you can get out of PyPy, ranging from
slightly faster than CPython to C speeds, depending on how you write your
programs.,We will split the talk in two parts. In the first part we will explain
how things work and what can and what cannot be optimized as well as describe
the basic heuristics of JIT compiler and optimizer. In the next part we will
do a survey of existing tools for looking at performance of Python programs
with specific focus on PyPy.,As a result of this talk, an audience member should be better equipped with
tools how to write new software and improve existing software with performance
in mind.,The talk will be given by Antonio Cuni and Maciej Fijalkowski,
both long time PyPy core developers and expert in the area of
Python performance.",Antonio Cuni

Tuesday 21 July,PySpark and Warcraft Data,"data-science,bigdata,analytics,machine-learning,numpy,pandas","In this talk I will describe how to use Apache Spark (PySpark) with some data from the World of Warcraft API from an iPython notebook.  Spark is interesting because it speeds up iterative processes on your hadoop cluster as well as your local machine. ,I will give basic benchmarks (comparing it to numpy/pandas/scikit), explain the architecture/performance behind the technology and will give a live demo on how I used Spark to analyse an interesting dataset. I’ll explain why you might want to use Spark and I’ll also go in and explain when you don’t want to use it. ,The dataset I will be using is a 22Gb json blob containing auction house data from all world of warcraft servers over a period of time. The goal of the analysis will be to determine when and if basic economics still applies in a massively online game. ,I will assume that the everyone knows what the ipython notebook is and I will assume a basic knowledge of numpy/pandas but nothing fancy. The dataset has been chosen such that people who are less interested in Spark can still enjoy the analysis part of the talk. If you know very little about data science but if you love video games then you should like this talk.",vincent warmerdam
Wednesday 22 July,PySpark - Data processing in Python on top of Apache Spark.,"analytics,data-science,bigdata,distributed-systems","Apache Spark, is a computational engine for large-scale data processing. It
is responsible for scheduling, distribution and monitoring applications which
consist of many computational task across many worker machines on a computing
cluster.,This Talk will give an overview of PySpark with a focus on Resilient
Distributed Datasets and the DataFrame API. While Spark Core itself is written
in Scala and runs on the JVM, PySpark exposes the Spark programming model to
Python. It defines an API for Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). RDDs are a
distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory
computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner. RDDs are immutable,
partitioned collections of objects. Transformations construct a new RDD from a
previous one. Actions compute a result based on an RDD. Multiple computation steps
are expressed as directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG execution model is 
a generalization of the Hadoop MapReduce computation model.,The Spark DataFrame API was introduced in Spark 1.3. DataFrames envolve Spark’s
RDD model and are inspired by Pandas and R data frames. The API provides
simplified operators for filtering, aggregating, and projecting over large
datasets. The DataFrame API supports diffferent data sources like JSON
datasources, Parquet files, Hive tables and JDBC database connections.,Resources:",Peter Hoffmann

The  education track bought educators and developers together in a way that allowed the teachers to get support and advice whilst developers   get to support teachers in developing exciting & real applications for teaching computing. ,The talk will focus on two aspects of the education track. The  workshops delivered for teachers by python developers and how this helps build teachers confidence.  But also the breakout sessions where educators and developers with common interests can work together to develop something. This might be a program / library or a teaching resource, some developers gave a hands on and bespoke training session to a group of teachers.,If we are to get more young people programming or at least having  a positive experience of programming then we need to minimize obstacles to that experience. By having educators and developers working together we can identify those obstacles and eliminate them!,https://goo.gl/nt05hC",James Robinson
Friday 24 July,Preparing Apps for Dynamic Scaling,Scalability,"Scalability is a big problem for everyone who wants to grow. In order to handle the demand, appropriate infrastructure both in terms of software and hardware should be met.

How your applications should evolve?",roy simkes
Friday 24 July,Practical usage of advanced Python constructs,"python,core","Python is a language of choice for developers with wide range of experience, for some it is a first programming language, others switch to Python after years of experience. Python provides friendly syntax and smooth learning curve. This sometimes leads to developers lacking comprehension of some more advanced constructs. ,It happens that experienced developers jump into using Python and sometimes miss less known Python language constructs. On the other hands people who purposefully learned Python sometimes lack practical ideas for how to apply those constructs.,This talk will be specifically focused on the practical usages of advanced Python constructs like iterators, generators, decorators and context managers. Goal of the talk is to share ideas about how those constructs can be used for practical purposes in real projects.

Friday 24 July,Parallelism Shootout: threads vs asyncio vs multiple processes,Parallelism,"You need to download data from lots and lots of URLs stored in a text file and then save them on your machine. Sure, you could write a loop and get each URL in sequence, but imagine that there are so many URLs that the sun may burn out before that loop is finished; or, you’re just too impatient.,For the sake of making this instructive, pretend you can only use one box. So, what do you do? Here are some typical solutions: Use a single process that creates lots of threads. Use many processes.

Multibody simulation (MBS) requires two major steps: first the formulation of the specific mechanical problem. Second step is the integration of the resulting equations.
For the first step we use the package sympy which is on a very advanced level to perform symbolic calculation and which supports already Lagrange’s and Kane’s formalism. The extensions we made are such that a complex mechanical setup can be formulated easily with several lines of python code. The functionality is analogous to well known MBS-tools, with that you can assemble bodies, joints, forces and constraints. Also external forces even in a cosimulation model can be added on top. The second step, the integration is done via ode-integrators implemented in scipy.
Finally for visual validation the results are visualized with the vpython package and for further analytics with matplotlib.,Conclusion: not only highly constrained pendulums with many rods and springs but also driving simulation of passenger cars an be performed with our new extension using python packages off the shelf.",Oliver Braun

Monday 20 July,Metrics-driven development,"metrics,technologies,servers,logging,real-time","At Spotify, my team struggled to be awesome.  We had a very loose understanding of what product/service our squad was responsible for, and even less so of the expectations our internal and external customers had for those services.  Other than “does our Facebook login work?”, we had no understanding of how our services we’re responsible for were doing.  How many users actually sign up or log in with Facebook? How many users have connected their Spotify account with their Uber account?  Do folks even use Spotify with Uber?  ,With a 2-month challenge period, my squad and I focused inward to establish those unanswered questions and to establish feedback loops and always-on dashboards.  This talk will tell the story of how we chose which metrics are important for us to focus on, what technologies we have used and are using, and how we’ve iterated over our feedback loops to fine-tune what metrics we care about.

Esto permite al programador ahorrar tiempo en la producción de código.”
En esta charla veremos diferentes mecanismos que Python proporciona como:
 - Decoradores
 - Metaclasses
 - Descriptors
A través de varios ejemplos veremos como reutilizar código en varias funciones y clases, como modificar como nuestras clases se generan, como se genera una clase (que funciones se llaman cuando una clase se crea) o como se genera una instancia.

Computing has adapted and we almost never wait for the computer for more then 10 seconds. One big exception is runnig a test suite which takes MINUTES on many projects. That is incredibly distracting, frustrating and dragging the whole concept of automated tests down. ,I present a technique and a tool (py.test plugin called “testmon"") which automatically selects only tests affected by recent changes. Does it sound too good to be true? Python developers rightfully have a suspecting attitude towards any tool which tries to be too clever about their source code. Code completion and symbol searching doesn’t need to be 100% reliable but messing with the test suite execution? I show that we can cut test suite execution time significantly but maintain it’s reliability.",Tibor Arpas
Monday 20 July,Machine Learning Under Test,"data-science,Testing,py.test,scipy,nose,machine-learning,numpy,sklearn","One point usually underestimated or omitted when dealing with 
machine learning algorithms is how to write ,good quality, code.
The obvious way to face this issue is to apply automated testing, which aims at implementing (likely) less-buggy and higher quality code.,However, testing machine learning code introduces additional concerns that has to be considered. On the one hand, some constraints are imposed by the domain, and the risks intrinsically related to machine learning methods, such as handling unstable data, or avoid under/overfitting. On the other hand,  testing scientific code requires additional testing tools (e.g., ,numpy.testing,), specifically suited to handle numerical data.,In this talk, some of the most famous machine learning techniques will be discudded and analysed from the ,testing, point of view, emphasizing that testing would also allow for a better understanding of how the whole learning model works under the hood.,The talk is intended for an ,intermediate, audience.

Done right, functional programs can be easily tested and provide more confidence that you program is really doing what you want. Mochi could be another tool in your toolbox. Functional programming can expand your horizon and can be a lot of fun. Mochi offers easy access to this new world because you can leverage your existing Python knowledge and libraries whenever needed.,Slides",Mike Müller

As an example I will present how to use Open Street Map data (http://openstreetmap.org/), in routing, traffic planning and estimation of pollution emission.,For the purpose of the project EcoSense (http://ecosense.au.dk), GPS data from users smartphones are mapped to OSM roads. The map matching algorithm is written in Python and uses data from the database PostgreSQL, with the PostGIS extension. ,One of the goals of the EcoSense project is to devise methods to improve the estimation of air quality in urban environments.",Anders Lehmann
Wednesday 22 July,How to build a spreadsheet with Python,"Beginners,demo,data,spreadsheet,data-science","Do you know how a spreadsheet works?  Can you imagine building one, from scratch, in Python?  This talk will be a whirlwind overview of how to do just that.  Based on the source code of Dirigible, a short-lived experiment in building a cloud-based Pythonic spreadsheet (now ,open-sourced,, for the curious).,We’ll start from scratch, with a simple data representation for a two-by-two grid, and then gradually build up the functionality of our spreadsheet:
- Cell objects, and the formula/value distinction
- Evaluating cells, from simple arithmetic up to an Excel-like dialect
- Building up the dependency graph, and the ensuing fun times with recursion (arg!)
- Integrating custom functions and user-defined code.,Showing and explaining code examples, and alternating with  live demos (don’t worry, I’ve done this before!),And it’s all in Python!  You’ll be surprised at how easy it turns out to be, when you go step-by-step, each building on the last… And I promise you’ll be at least a couple of  moderately mind-blowing moments :)",Harry Percival
Thursday 23 July,gitfs - building a filesystem in Python,"open-source,cpython,DevOps,pytest,concurrency,linux,fun,FOSS,low-level","gitfs is an open-source[1] filesystem which was designed to bring the full powers of Git to everyone, no matter how little they know about versioning. A user can mount any repository and all the his changes will be automatically converted into commits. gitfs will also expose the history of the branch you’re currently working on by simulating snapshots of every commit.,gitfs is useful in places where you want to keep track of all your files, but at the same time you don’t have the possibility of organizing everything into commits yourself. A FUSE filesystem for git repositories, with local cache.,In this talk we will take a look at some of the crucial aspects involved in building a reliable FUSE filesystem, the steps that we took in building gitfs, especially in handling the git objects (http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects), what testing methods we have used for it and also we will share the most important lessons learned while building it.,The prerequisites for this talk are:

But if I can write more Python and less JavaScript… well, that makes me happy! ,Bokeh is a new Python library for interactive visualization. Its origins are in the data science community, but it has a lot to offer web developers. In this mini-tutorial, I’ll run through how to build a data visualization in Bokeh and how to hook it into your web application. This will be a real-world example, that was previously built in d3.js. ,Along the way, I’ll provide tips and tricks that I’ve discovered in my experience including how Bokeh works wonderfully with the iPython notebook which I use to prototype my visualizations, and many data science people use as their native way to explore data.,For those of you who already know a little Bokeh, I’ll be covering the new “actions framework” that lets you write JS callbacks in your python code so you can do lots of interactions all on the client side.",Sarah Bird
Monday 20 July,Getting more out of Matplotlib with GR,"visualization,OpenGL,python,Julia,html5,ipython,performance,PyPy","Python is well established in software development departments of research and industry, not least because of the proliferation of libraries such as ,SciPy, and ,Matplotlib,. However, when processing large amounts of data, in particular in combination with GUI toolkits (,Qt,) or three-dimensional visualizations (,OpenGL,), Python as an interpretative programming language seems to be reaching its limits. In particular, large amounts of data or the visualization of three-dimensional scenes may overwhelm the system.,This presentation shows how visualization applications with special performance requirements can be designed on the basis of ,Matplotlib, and ,GR,, a high-performance visualization library for Linux, OS X and Windows. The lecture focuses on the development of a new graphics backend for ,Matplotlib, based on the ,GR, framework. By combining the power of those libraries the responsiveness of animated visualization applications and their resulting frame rates can be improved significantly. This in turn allows the use of ,Matplotlib, in real-time environments, for example in the area of signal processing.,Using concrete examples, the presentation will demonstrate the benefits of the ,GR framework, as a companion module for ,Matplotlib,, both in ,Python, and ,Julia,. Based on selected applications, the suitability of the ,GR framework, will be highlighted especially in environments where time is critical. The system’s performance capabilities will be illustrated using demanding live applications. In addition, the special abilities of the ,GR framework, are emphasized in terms of interoperability with graphical user interfaces (,Qt/PySide,) and ,OpenGL,, which opens up new possibilities for existing ,Matplotlib, applications.",Josef Heinen

Verified fakes solve this problem.
Verified fakes allow for simplified testing using fakes while still providing the assurance that code tested using a fake implementation will behave the same way when used with a real implementation.,The talk will begin with a case-study, demonstrating what it means to write a “verified fake” implementation of a public API.
I will show how to write tests that verify a fake implementation of a well defined API
and I will show how those same tests can be re-used to verify and test real implementations of the same API.",Richard Wall
Friday 24 July,External authentication for Django projects,"web,HTTP,sssd,django,authentication,Apache,FreeIPA","When applications get deployed in enterprise environment or in large organizations, they need to support user accounts and groups that are managed externally, in existing directory services like FreeIPA or Active Directory, or federated via protocols like SAML. While it is possible to  add support for these individual setups and protocols directly to application code or to Web frameworks or libraries, often it is better to delegate the authentication and identity operations to a frontend server and just assume that the application has to be able to consume results of the external authentication and identity lookups.,In this talk, we will look at Django Web framework and how with few small changes to the framework and to the application we can extend the functionality of existing RemoteUserMiddleware and RemoteUserBackend to consume users coming from enterprise identity management systems. We will focus on using proven OS-level components such as SSSD for Web applications, but will also show setup using federation.",Jan Pazdziora

Friday 24 July,DumbDev -- eight rules for dumb development,"rules,community,software-design,best-practices,unit-testing,dumbdev,massage","So often, we’ve been encouraged to be smart in our development. “Work smarter not harder!” say the encouraging posters. But the desire to be smart, and be seen to be smart, is hurting. The design suffers, the code suffers, and it’s hard to recruit developers smart enough to cope with the problems caused.,In this talk, I’m proposing an alternative to being smart: ,DumbDev,. Let’s use our brains for enjoyable, interesting things, rather than wrestling with code written for smart developers.,So what do I mean by ,dumb,?,Well, I don’t mean ‘ignorant’. A clever person can be ignorant of some important information, and learn it. With ignorance, there is hope. I’m also not talking about its opposite, ‘stupidity’. This occurs when someone is given the information or advice, and chooses to ignore it. Dumb isn’t stupid. Nor is it silent, as in someone who can’t speak.,Instead, the picture I have is of one of the early computers: very small RAM, disk space measured in KB, and a woefully inadequate CPU. In other words, slow, with very little working memory and limited persistent storage. Hey, this describes my brain – and I realise that’s an asset! I will write better software if I take this into account.,Here’s the first ,DumbDev, rule, putting a sensible limit on complexity:,1. All diagrams must fit on a Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe) board,.,One central class/concept and up to eight things linked. Larger structures need to be subdivided.",Rob Collins
Thursday 23 July,Diversity: We are not done yet,"diversity,equality,community,social","The past few years, we have made large strides to welcome more diverse people into our community.  You see better gender ratios in attendance numbers at Python conferences, the billed speakers, the amount of women-centric programs.  We can see the benefits of outreach.  But we’re not done yet.,While a lot of the Python community embraces the importance of being diverse, we haven’t taken that mindset to our workplace.  From recruiting, we still hear, “sure, we wanted to recruit women, but we couldn’t find them” and “we only focus on quality here, not gender!”  Within company cultures, we hear “gender equality isn’t a problem here!” or “women don’t ask for a higher salary” and to “just lean in!”,This talk will recount the diversity efforts of the past few years and quantify the effects on the Python community.  But this talk will also address the not-so-low-hanging fruit; the  deeper-rooted problems that still plague the community from inside where we work.  And it will talk the audience through actionable items to improve one’s work place that welcomes more diversity.",Lynn Root

Wednesday 22 July,Distributed locks with Python and Redis,"redis,twisted,concurrency","Traditional methods of coping with concurrent programming problems are well-known and described in literature. Many programming languages, including Python, contain in their standard libraries tools and primitives such as semaphores and can spawn threads or subprocesses.,However, in the face of increasing interest in service oriented architecture and building distributed systems, that span across many independent server nodes, emerges a need to adapt traditional solutions, so they can be applied in the new environment.,In this talk I will share my experiences gathered during building a modern contact center - highly concurrent system, which requires certain resources to be accessed exclusively by several self-contained components.",Sebastian Buczyński

This transformative cycle uses Python big-hitters such as Scrapy, Pandas and Flask, the latter delivering data to Javascript’s D3.,While Python is fast becoming the goto language for data-processing/science, the visual fruits of that labour hit the wall of the web, where there is only one first-class language, Javascript. To develop a data-viz toolchain for the modern world, where web-presentation is increasingly mandated, making Python and Javascript play nicely is fundamental. This talk aims to show that the perceived wall between the two languages is actually a thin, permeable membrane and that, with a bare minimum of web-dev, one can get on with programming seamlessly in both.",Kyran Dale

However starting a new Python project can be tiring if you decide to stick to best practices and plan on submitting it to PyPI. It requires great diligence and occasionally gets pretty cumbersome if you start new tools on a regular basis.,Why not just use a template for it? Cookiecutter is a CLI tool written in pure Python that enables you to do so. Not only is it working for Python code, but also markdown formats and even other programming languages.

Tuesday 21 July,Code is not text! How graph technologies can help us to understand our code better.,"Best Practice,visualization,code,graphdatabases,python,Programming,bigdata,futureofcoding","Today, we almost exclusively think of code in software projects as a collection of text files. The tools that we use (version control systems, IDEs, code analyzers) also use text as the primary storage format for code. In fact, the belief that “code is text” is so deeply ingrained in our heads that we never question its validity or even become aware of the fact that there are other ways to look at code.,In my talk I will explain why treating code as text is a very bad idea which actively holds back our understanding and creates a range of problems in large software projects. I will then show how we can overcome (some of) these problems by treating and storing code as data, and more specifically as a graph. I will show specific examples of how we can use this approach to improve our understanding of large code bases, increase code quality and automate certain aspects of software development.,Finally, I will outline my personal vision of the future of programming, which is a future where we no longer primarily interact with code bases using simple text editors.

This talk explores the pain points we experienced along the ways, how our service-oriented architecture alleviates them, and the infrastructure we built to develop, test, and deploy in this highly-distributed environment. As a case study, we’ll be looking at the backend powering the new Yelp Business Owner Android and iOS apps.,At the start, most of the development at Yelp occurred in a single, monolithic web application, creatively named “yelp-main” (naming is hard!). As the company grew, our developers were spending increasing amounts of time trying to ship code. After recognizing this pain point, we started experimenting with a service oriented architecture to scale the development process, and so far it’s been a resounding success. Over the course of the last three years, we’ve gone from writing our first service to having over seventy production services.

We wanted to use as much of SQLAlchemy as possible, but we quickly found that the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is not suitable for handling large amounts of data at once. At the same time, we did not want each team of developers working on individual business domains to have to handcraft their own SQL statements. To solve this problem, we built an application configuration that closely resembles an SQLAlchemy model, but also contains application-specific logic settings.,In this talk I will demonstrate:,an application architecture for multiple business domains,the structure of the domain configuration utilized in the generation of the SQLAlchemy model, SQLAlchemy core statements, and other application functionality,how the domain configuration is used throughout the application (consuming and parsing incoming data, storing it in a database and ensuring data quality)",Christian Trebing
Friday 24 July,Bringing PostgreSQL towards zero downtime migration with Python,"postgresql,psycopg,Database","Using an SQL database offers a bunch of advantages; first of all its maturity and that it is understood by almost every software developer. But it has at least one main disadvantage. As the data is structured, if you want to modify the structure, for example on a long-running project, you need a migration and therefore almost for sure, a downtime.,When you have to make a migration, to modify the structure of data for a small amount of records, it is so fast that it never gets problematic. But if you think to modify the structure of tables containing millions or billions of records, the time required to simply apply the structural change is problematic.,Here are some changes we are working on at orderbird to go towards zero downtime migrations using some of the latest improvements of PostgreSQL 9.4, mainly logical replication and mixing in a little magic of some python scripting with psycopg.,Slide also available on Scribd: ,https://www.scribd.com/doc/272917622/EuroPython-2015-Rigal-Bringing-Postgres-Towards-Zero-downtime-Migration",Matthieu Rigal
Monday 20 July,Brainwaves for Hackers 2.0,"visualization,biology,Health-Science,machine-learning","This talk is a sequel to “Brainwaves for Hackers” and illustrates some experiments you can do with a Neurosky Mindwave headset, a bluetooth enabled EEG device.,I’ll also talk some more about how to integrate the device with the IPython

Friday 24 July,Big Data with Python & Hadoop,"jython,cpython,bigdata,hadoop,PyPy,etl","Big Data - these two words are heard so often nowadays. But what exactly is Big Data ? Can we, Pythonistas, enter the wonder world of Big Data ? The answer is definitely “Yes”.,This talk is an introduction to the big data processing using Apache Hadoop and Python. We’ll talk about Apache Hadoop, it’s concepts, infrastructure and how one can use Python with it. We’ll compare the speed of Python jobs under different Python implementations, including CPython, PyPy and Jython and also discuss what Python libraries are available out there to work with Apache Hadoop.,This talk is intended for beginners who want to know about Hadoop and Python or those who are already working with Hadoop but are wondering how to use it with Python or how to speed up their Python jobs.,Slides for this talk are available ,here, and code used for benchmarks can be found ,here,.",Max Tepkeev
Monday 20 July,Big data beautiful visualization on the browser with Bokeh,"visualization,data-science,web,flask,bigdata,django,html5,data","Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library for large datasets that natively uses the latest web technologies. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of Protovis/D3, while delivering high-performance interactivity over large data to thin clients.,The talk will go through it’s design providing details of the different API layers (bottom to top) concluding with a comprehensive showcase of examples to expose many of the features that make Bokeh so powerful and easy.",Fabio Pliger
Friday 24 July,Beyond the basics with Elasticsearch,"analytics,search,elasticsearch,bigdata,open-source","Elasticsearch has many use cases, some of them fairly obvious and widely used, like plain searching through documents or analytics. In this talk I would like to go through some of the more advanced scenarios we have seen in the wild. Some examples of what we will cover:,Trend detection - how you can use the aggregation framework to go beyond simple “counting” and make use of the full-text properties of Elasticsearch.,Percolator - percolator is reversed search and many people use it as such to drive alerts or “stored search” functionality for their website, let’s look at how we can use it to detect languages, geo locations or drive live search.,If we end up with some time to spare we can explore some other ideas about how we can utilize the features of a search engine to drive non-trivial data analysis including Geo-enabled search with relevancy.",Honza Král
Tuesday 21 July,Beyond grep: Practical Logging and Metrics,"metrics,errors,logging,DevOps","Knowing that your application is up and running is great. However in order to make informed decisions about the future, you also need to know in what state your application currently is and how its state is developing over time.,This talk combines two topics that are usually discussed separately. However I do believe that they have a lot of overlap and ultimately a similar goal: giving you vital insights about your system in production.,We’ll have a look at their commonalities, differences, popular tools, and how to apply everything in your own systems while avoiding some common pitfalls.,Slides & Notes,:  ,https://hynek.me/talks/beyond-grep/",Hynek Schlawack
Thursday 23 July,Better asynchronous code with Tornado and Python 3,"tornado,web,python3,asyncio","The asyncio module introduced in Python 3.4 is a game-changer for I/O management and event-driven network programming in Python. Aiming to be a lower-level implementation of an asynchronous event loop, it intends that higher level frameworks like Tornado, Twisted or Gevent will build on top of it, taking advantage of the shared interface for writing concurrent event-driven code across different Python frameworks.,This talk connects theory with practice, presenting how Tornado can run in the asyncio event loop and take advantage of the subgenerator delegation syntax (yield from) to provide a high degree of concurrency while keeping the simplicity of sequential code. It explains the concept of coroutines, futures and ioloop, exposing Python 3 code for sample web tasks. The talk completes with a basic demo of running this code on Tornado, comparing its syntax and performance with popular asynchronous frameworks from other languages.",Anton Caceres
Thursday 23 July,BDD: You’re doing it wrong!,"test,bdd,selenium,django","Talk about mistakes we made and best practises we have elaborated while implementation Behave Driven Development into one of the projects. Great idea to coverage whole application with functional tests fall down in development chaos and reborn on new better foundations.,Project referred is web-based big data management which main features are transcoding and file sharing. Thanks to Django and many Python frameworks we have web interface for it and we are able to run automation tests with Selenium.",Rafał Nowicki
Monday 20 July,Asyncio Stack & React.js or Development on the Edge,"es6,aiohttp,aiopg,react.js,flux,api,aioredis,python3,asyncio","Times changed, with introducing asyncio to Python standard library many and many developers think about switching from previous solutions to aio stack. Talk will introduce aiohttp, aioredis & aiopg - cornerstones for building modern Python backends and show common problems & solutions while switching to aio stack.,But not only Python changed. In second part, I’ll talk about what new happened in frontend development, how new ES6 features modified JavaScript, and what React.js & Flux means for Python developers. ,Talk will cover real-world web application, which used aio stack on backend and React.js & Flux approach on frontend and provide useful observations for other developers interested in these topics.",Igor Davydenko
